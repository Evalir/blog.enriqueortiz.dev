> I guess everybody writes this at some point.

Iâ€™ve tried blogging before, as Iâ€™ve always liked it, but now I plan to go serious about it; not with a fixed schedule, but to be able to share things I write for myself, and also interesting thoughts that come up from time to time.

Now, hi!

I could totally write a super cool introduction letter, but I prefer to take this as a crash course on getting to know me ðŸ˜Ž.  Iâ€™m Enrique, a 20 years old guy from the Caribbean who has been sitting on a computer for far too long since he was 2 years old. You can call me Henry, or even by my username, Evalir (more on that later) if itâ€™s more comfortable to you; I answer to all three! 

I love many things, many I probably havenâ€™t discovered yet, but I know that in the future Iâ€™ll get obsessed with something new, because thatâ€™s how I am. Until now, what I love doing is [Making and listening to music](https://evalir.bandcamp.com/),  reading (even though Iâ€™ve lost the habit recently), teaching whatever, usually data structures and algorithms, and programming, by a long shot! I *love* much more things, but, hey, you canâ€™t do everything all at once right?

Iâ€™m the kind of guy that will probably be really quiet until you say certain keywords, like: instruments, music, metal, blockchain, graphic, programming, DOOM, performance, concentration, remote work, art, climbing; there I fire up. If you talk about something I don't know about, I'll be even more excited. A lot of things that tend to be less conventional are pretty interesting, because, life is short and so I must try all the things! As a result, my life is sort of an experiment: Iâ€™m just a pretty short "latino" guy (Iâ€™m 5â€™6 and I certainly donâ€™t mind!), in a tropical island in the middle of the world.  How far can I go?

_Disclaimer: I canâ€™t dance, but I swear Iâ€™m learning_

I donâ€™t know if I have anything else to add. You can reach me anywhere, as I love chatting with humans. With that said, I welcome you to my naked-thoughts space.
